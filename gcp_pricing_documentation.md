## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of cloud infrastructure costs using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Pricing Calculator. The configuration detailed below represents a production-ready deployment incorporating compute resources, managed database services, and domain name management capabilities. Each service has been carefully selected and configured to provide a balanced infrastructure that meets modern application hosting requirements while maintaining cost efficiency.

## 1. Step-by-Step Configuration Process

### 1.1 Initial Landing Page
<div align="center">

![GCP Calculator Landing](/home/ubuntu/screenshots/cloud_google_055346.png)

*Initial Calculator Access:*
1. Navigated to the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator interface, which provides a comprehensive tool for estimating cloud infrastructure costs
2. The landing page presents a clean interface with service categories on the left and configuration options in the main panel
3. Users can begin their cost estimation by selecting from various Google Cloud services, with Compute Engine highlighted as the primary compute service
</div>

### 1.2 Compute Engine Configuration
<div align="center">

![Compute Engine Setup](/home/ubuntu/screenshots/cloud_google_055407.png)

*Compute Engine Service Configuration:*
1. Configured a production-grade n1-standard-4 instance with 4 vCPUs and 15 GB memory for optimal performance and resource allocation
2. Selected the Iowa (us-central1) region for low-latency access and configured Ubuntu as the operating system for maximum compatibility
3. Established full month usage (730 hours) resulting in a cost-effective monthly rate of $139.70 for sustained compute resources
</div>

### 1.3 Cloud SQL Configuration
<div align="center">

![Cloud SQL Setup](/home/ubuntu/screenshots/cloud_google_055506.png)

*Database Service Configuration:*
1. Implemented a robust MySQL Enterprise edition database with db-standard-2 instance type for reliable data management
2. Optimized resource allocation with 2 vCPUs, 7.5 GB memory, and 100 GB storage to support growing data requirements
3. Deployed in the same region (us-central1) as Compute Engine for minimal latency, with a monthly operational cost of $115.62
</div>

### 1.4 Cloud DNS Configuration
<div align="center">

![Cloud DNS Setup](/home/ubuntu/screenshots/cloud_google_055618.png)

*DNS Service Configuration:*
1. Established a professional DNS infrastructure with 5 managed zones to support multiple domain management requirements
2. Configured capacity for 10 million regular queries per month to ensure reliable name resolution for high-traffic applications
3. Implemented global DNS service through Google's worldwide network for $5.00 per month, providing enterprise-grade domain management
</div>

### 1.5 Total Cost Summary
*Final Deployment Costs:*
- Compute Engine: $139.70/month
- Cloud SQL (MySQL): $115.62/month
- Cloud DNS: $5.00/month
- **Total Monthly Cost: $260.32**

## 2. Service Selection Justification

### 2.1 Compute Engine
The n1-standard-4 machine type was selected to provide robust computing capabilities:
- 4 vCPUs ensure sufficient processing power for application workloads
- 15 GB memory supports concurrent operations and caching
- Ubuntu OS provides a stable, well-supported environment

### 2.2 Cloud SQL
MySQL Enterprise edition was chosen for reliable database operations:
- Fully managed database service reduces operational overhead
- db-standard-2 instance provides balanced CPU and memory allocation
- 100 GB storage accommodates growing data requirements

### 2.3 Cloud DNS
DNS service configuration supports production-grade domain management:
- 5 managed zones allow multiple domain management
- 10 million queries/month capacity ensures reliable DNS resolution
- Low-latency global DNS serving through Google's worldwide network

## 3. Technical Implementation Details

### 3.1 Infrastructure Architecture
The selected services form a cohesive infrastructure stack:
- Compute Engine provides the primary application hosting environment
- Cloud SQL offers a reliable, managed database backend
- Cloud DNS ensures reliable domain name resolution and routing

### 3.2 Performance Considerations
Each service has been sized for optimal performance:
- N1-standard-4 machine type balances CPU and memory for general workloads
- Cloud SQL db-standard-2 instance type provides dedicated resources for database operations
- DNS configuration supports high-volume query requirements

### 3.3 Scalability and Reliability
The infrastructure design incorporates several reliability features:
- Compute Engine instances can be scaled horizontally as needed
- Cloud SQL provides automated backups and maintenance
- Cloud DNS offers global redundancy through Google's network

## 4. Cost Optimization Analysis

### 4.1 Resource Allocation
The monthly cost breakdown reflects strategic resource allocation:
1. Compute Engine ($139.70) - 53.7% of total cost
2. Cloud SQL ($115.62) - 44.4% of total cost
3. Cloud DNS ($5.00) - 1.9% of total cost

### 4.2 Cost-Saving Opportunities
Potential optimizations for future consideration:
- Committed use discounts for predictable workloads
- Storage optimization in Cloud SQL
- Reserved IP addresses for static workloads

## 5. Conclusion
The Google Cloud Platform configuration detailed in this document represents a well-balanced infrastructure deployment with a total monthly cost of $260.32. The selected services—Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, and Cloud DNS—provide a robust foundation for hosting production applications while maintaining cost efficiency. The n1-standard-4 Compute Engine instance offers sufficient computing power, while the Cloud SQL database ensures reliable data management. The addition of Cloud DNS provides professional domain management capabilities, completing a comprehensive cloud infrastructure solution.
