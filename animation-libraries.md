# Animation Libraries Documentation

## Core Animation Libraries
1. Anime.js (v3.2.2)
   - Purpose: Lightweight JavaScript animation library
   - Use: Smooth transitions, transforms, and timeline animations
   - Primary for: Team member cards, hover effects

2. Remotion (v4.0.267)
   - Purpose: Create videos programmatically in React
   - Use: Complex animations and video-like transitions
   - Primary for: Hero section animations

3. React Move (v6.5.0)
   - Purpose: Data visualization animations
   - Use: Animate charts and data-driven components
   - Primary for: Statistics and metrics animations

4. Framer Motion (v12.4.7)
   - Purpose: Production-ready motion library for React
   - Use: Page transitions and gesture animations
   - Primary for: Page transitions, scroll animations

5. React Reveal (v1.2.2)
   - Purpose: React components for adding reveal animations
   - Use: Scroll-triggered reveal effects
   - Primary for: Content reveal animations

6. Popmotion (v11.0.5)
   - Purpose: Functional, flexible JavaScript animation
   - Use: Physics-based animations and spring effects
   - Primary for: Interactive UI elements

7. Three.js (v0.173.0)
   - Purpose: 3D graphics library
   - Use: 3D animations and effects
   - Primary for: Background effects, 3D elements

8. Mo.js (v0.2.0)
   - Purpose: Motion graphics library
   - Use: Burst animations and custom effects
   - Primary for: Button click effects, notifications

9. Zdog (v1.1.3)
   - Purpose: Pseudo-3D engine for canvas
   - Use: Flat design 3D illustrations
   - Primary for: Logo animations, decorative elements

## Implementation Strategy
1. Use Anime.js for basic transitions and transforms
2. Implement Framer Motion for page transitions
3. Add React Reveal for scroll animations
4. Enhance with Three.js for background effects
5. Use Mo.js for micro-interactions
6. Apply Zdog for decorative elements
7. Implement Remotion for complex sequences
8. Use React Move for data visualizations
9. Fine-tune with Popmotion for physics-based effects

## Performance Considerations
- Load libraries on demand using dynamic imports
- Use lightweight alternatives when possible
- Implement proper cleanup for animations
- Consider reduced motion preferences
- Monitor bundle size impact
